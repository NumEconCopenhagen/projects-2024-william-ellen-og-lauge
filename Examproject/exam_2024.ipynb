    "The left graph illustrates that both average subjective expected utility and average realized utility increase as graduates consult more friends. Now that there is a switching cost, we see that expected utility is much lower than in Question 2.2. Therefore, we also see that the difference in utilities for each type of graduate is lower (from 0.0-0.18 difference, where the gap was from 0.2-1.5 in exercise 2.2). The gap between expected and realized utility is still larger when there is less information available, particularly for graduates with fewer friends. This indicates that more information leads to better-informed career decisions, aligning expectations more closely with actual outcomes. The most significant improvements in utility occur with early information, demonstrating its high value in decision-making. As the number of friends increases, the utilities stabilize, showing diminishing returns from additional information.\n",

    "The right graph shows that the highest share of graduates initially choosing Career 1 switch careers, with around 35-40% switching, despite the switching cost. Career 2 has a moderate switch rate of approximately 20%, while Career 3 has the lowest switch rate at approximately 10%. This indicates that Career 3 provides the highest intrinsic utility, making graduates less likely to switch."

    "The results highlight the effectiveness of triangle-based interpolation for approximating $f(y)$ in a 2D space. Points where triangles $ABC$ and $CDA$ are formed generally yield close approximations to the true values of $f(y)$, demonstrating the method's accuracy. For example, at point $y = (0.2, 0.2)$, the approximation using triangle $ABC$ ($0.04032631372248057$) is very close to the true value of $0.04$ because of the fact that point y lies within triangle $ABC$ and benefits from a precise interpolation. In contrast, at $y = (0.8, 0.8)$, where no suitable triangles could be formed, accurate approximations were not possible, underscoring the method's dependency on the availability of neighboring points for triangulation."
