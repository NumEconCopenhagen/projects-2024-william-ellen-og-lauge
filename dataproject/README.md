# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **Denmark's demographic development until 2070** and is about Denmark's demographic evolution until 2070, leveraging data from Danmarks Statistik. The project analyzes the population composition, including age, gender, and origin. Further, the project examines population projections and generates interactive population pyramids for Denmark spanning from 2023 to 2070.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

We apply the **following datasets**:

%pip install git+https://github.com/alemartinello/dstapi
from dstapi import DstApi

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install matplotlib-venn``
