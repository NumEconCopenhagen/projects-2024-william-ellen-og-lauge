# Inaugural project

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [inauguralproject.ipynb](inauguralproject.ipynb).

The project considers a simple, economic model and presents the results. We consider an exchange economy with two consumers and find Walras-equillibrium and Pareto-optimality under several conditions. 

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.

**Authors:** William Gormsen (rxs964), Lauge Koch-Klarskov (zxn850) and Ellen Christine HÃ¸jlund (npv380)
