# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **An AS/AD-model for a closed economy in the short run** and is about the effects of shocks to a simple AS/AD-model for a closed economy in the short run. We use the model to analyze supply- and demand shocks as well as minimizing a social loss function.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
