This shock could arise from increased government spending, reduced taxes, or adjustments in monetary policy parameters such as the sensitivity of nominal interest rates to output gap changes. Initially, both the output gap and inflation rise in response to this positive shock. In the subsequent period, although the demand shock dissipates, static inflation expectations persist among economic agents, leading them to anticipate continued higher inflation. However, actual inflation turns out to be lower than expected, resulting in a negative output gap. As agents gradually revise their expectations to match observed inflation, inflation converges back to its original level post-shock.\n",

    "The initial values show a demand shock, z, of value 0.01, with a duration of 1 period (and no supply shock). We see that in period 1, the demand shock raises output and inflation above long-term levels (economic boom). Increased demand boosts production and employment, leading to higher costs and inflation. The central bank responds with a tightening policy more than one-for-one with inflation, raising real interest rates and dampening demand. In period 2, the AD-curve shifts back to the initial AD-curve, as the demand shock fades. Higher inflation expectations from period 1 shift AS left/up in period 2, anticipating inflation. This drives wage demands, accelerates prices, and sustains elevated inflation. The central bank continues tightening to stabilize inflation. In the subsequent periods, inflation expectations adjust to period the former periods’ observed inflation, shifting AS downward. Over time, output returns to its long-term level and inflation stabilizes. Nominal wage rigidities and slow expectation adjustments influence this process.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Temporary supply shock:**\n",
    "If we instead change the sliders to a negative value of $s=-0.01$ and a duration of s of 1 (and no demand shock), this corresponds to a positive supply shock, like in the analysis for Figure 1 above. In the first period, a temporary positive supply shock ($s < 0$) shifts AS down by the size of the shock s, creating a new short-term equilibrium. Inflation falls to $\\pi_1 < \\pi^*$, but not entirely with the shock’s size, as the central bank responds by easing monetary policy (lowering interest rates), boosting output ($y_1>\\bar{y}$). In the second period where $s=0$, AS shifts up. However, static expectations prompt the agents to adjust inflation expectations, keeping the AS-curve from returning directly. In all subsequent periods, inflation expectations adjust to observed inflation in the former period, pushing AS gradually up. Successive expectation adjustments lead output towards $\\bar{y}$ and inflation towards $\\pi^*$. Persistence in convergence is due to nominal wage rigidities and slow adjustment of expectations."

    "We find that the optimal alpha is 2.5, which gives an outputgap after the shock of approx. zero. This alpha is higher than the empirical value of 0.7 from Whitta-Jacobsen and Birch Sørensen. In the numerical solution, we aim to minimize outputgap after the given shocks, why it is not surprising that we find a high alpha-value. A high alpha-value suggest an extremely high sensitivity of output to changes in inflation and supply shocks. Such a high alpha value implies that even small changes in inflation or supply shocks lead to very large adjustments in output from the central bank. This is due to a high value of h, meaning that the central bank adjusts the interest rate more when there are changes in inflation. "

    "In conclusion, this project has examined the impact of shocks on a basic AS/AD model within a closed economy in the short term. Through our analysis, we investigated the repercussions of variations in shocks and a social loss function, and found the optimal alpha to minimize outputgap after shocks."
